# WordPress to Contentful

Migrate WordPress posts to Contentful using the WP REST API and the Contentful JS SDK.

- **Markdown**: Post bodies are converted to Markdown to strip out inline styles and image dimensions.
- **Assets**: Featured and inline images will be transferred and their references in content replaced.
- **Authors**: Script looks for CF Person names that match WP User and reassign author attribution.
- **Date Published**: Preserved

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### Webhooks

Make sure to temporarily disable any publish webhooks (e.g. Netlify) because this is gonna do a lot of publishing.

### Globally installed

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [Contentful CLI](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli) (Logged in)

### Contentful Content Types

Assumes the following content types are already created in Contentful:

#### Person: `person`

For best results, create Persons with matching names so posts authors in the two systems can be matched up and attributions preserved. Otherwise, the fallback Person ID will be used.

#### Blog Post: `blogPost`

See fields in source

### Contentful Content Management API

Contentful CMA tokens have access to all environments for migration purposes so make sure to double-check the relevant config var to see which is being targeted.

- [Personal Access Token](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/personal-access-tokens)

### WP Users API route

The `/wp-json/wp/v2/users` should return a paginated list of users, if it does not and returns an error like the one below (via Wordfence) it will need to be enabled before the author tasks can run effectively:

```json
{
  "code": "rest_user_cannot_view",
  "message": "Sorry, you are not allowed to list users.",
  "data": {
    "status": 401
  }
}
```
